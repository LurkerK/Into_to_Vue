2. Property "total" was accessed during render but is not defined on instance.

What does this Vue warning message mean? 
    You are trying to use the variable "total" when it has yet to be defined.


Can you safely ignore it? 
    The warning should not be ignored. 
        - the "total" will not display in the webpage.
        - debugging will be more of a hastle.


What causes it? 
    At least 1 of 3 things is true regarding the "total" property:
        - it has yet to be defined in the "setup" section.
        - it hasn't been included in the "return" section.
        - there is a typo in the code pertaining to it.


How do you fix it? 
    I would first focus my attention on the computed properties.
    At least in the case of the "cart.html" created in the videos,
    The return statement is directly under the section in which
    the reactive properties are defined. I would check that the
    "total" property is defined and returned. Should the error
    persist, I would then look to the table and make check that
    the code for the total being outputted is correct.
